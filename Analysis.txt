When the distance is set to 60 away from the ghosts,
 the pac man character is too sensitive to where the ghosts are and ends up becoming trapped. 
When its lower for example 10 and 20 the main player ends up waiting too close and ends up easily trapped
whereas when its at 40 the player is able react better and wont get trapped as easily. 
In my various tests it was able to hit 1220 whereas for some of the other numbers barly made it over 200

In the full chase mode one the power code part isnt working properly,
so its torn between chasing the ghosts that will kill you and slowly moving toward the power pill.

I was able to get the logging to work but im unsure as to how comparing 
it would help because its moving randomly at some points every time
